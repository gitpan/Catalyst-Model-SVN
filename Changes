    - Re-written to not leak connections or RAM. SVN::Client removed. Almost complete re-write 'under the hood'.
    - Test suite which tests the module for real + stress test added
    - Removed (non working) realpath method on Catalyst::Model::SVN::Item
    - Added a (horrifically inefficient) propget method to Catalyst::Model::SVN::Item
    - Cleaned up path handling in cat and ls methods to conform. You can now supply either a path from the repository root, or an entire URI, to both methods.

    - Move Catalyst::Model::SVN::Item class into it's own file.
    - Added a test for kwalitee
