NAME
    Catalyst::Model::SVN - Catalyst Model to browse Subversion repositories

SYNOPSIS
        my $path = join('/', $c->req->args);
        my $revision = $c->req->param('revision') || 'HEAD';

        $c->stash->{'repository_revision'} = MyApp::M::SVN->revision;
        $c->stash->{'items'} = MyApp::M::SVN->ls($path, $revision);

DESCRIPTION
    This model class uses the perl-subversion bindings to access a
    Subversion repository and list items and view their contents. It is
    currently only a read-only client but may expand to be a fill fledged
    client at a later time.

CONFIG
    The following configuration options are available:

  repository
    This is the full path to the root of your Subversion repository. This
    can be one of http://, svn://, or file:/// schemes.

  revision
    This is the default revision to use when no revision is specified. By
    default, this will be "HEAD".

METHODS
  cat($path [, $revision])
    Returns the contents of the path specified.

  ls($path [, $revision])
    Returns a array of "Catalyst::Model::SVN::Item" objects in list context,
    each representing an entry in the specified repository path. In scalar
    context, it returns an array reference.

    Each "Catalyst::Model::SVN::Item" object has the following methods:

    author
        The author of the latest revision of the current item.

    contents
        The contents of the of the current item. This is the same as calling
        "Catalyst::Model::SVN-"cat($item->uri, $item->revision)

    is_directory
        Returns 1 if the current item is a directory; 0 otherwise.

    is_file
        Returns 1 if the current item is a file; 0 otherwise.

    kind
        Returns the kind of the current item. See SVN::Core for the possible
        types, usually $SVN::Node::path or $SVN::Node::file.

    log Returns the last log entry for the current item. Be forewarned, this
        makes an extra call to the repository, which is slow. Only use this
        if you are listing a single item, and not when looping through large
        collections of items.

    name
        Returns the name of the current item.

    path
        Returns the path of the current item relative to the repository
        root.

    revision
        Returns the revision of the current item.

    size
        Returns the raw file size in bytes for the current item.

    time
        Returns the last modified time of the current item as a DateTime
        object.

    uri Returns the full repository path of the current item.

  repository
    Returns the repository specified in the configuration "repository"
    option.

  revision
    Returns the latest revisions of the repository you are connected to.
